# Plain-Terminal-Library

Ptlib is a cross platform, single header library which povides a layer of abstraction for raw input and graphics in the command line.

The goal is to provide a small set of functions that you can build upon. 
input and graphics are as basic as it gets, but it hides away the boilerplate code.

the library should support windows, mac and linux.
